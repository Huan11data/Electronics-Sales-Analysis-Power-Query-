## Objective
The analysis aimed to evaluate sales performance by identifying trends and actionable insights using key performance indicators (KPIs). A comprehensive report was developed for stakeholders to assess revenue trends, product category performance, and other critical metrics.
## Data Preparation
The dataset was distributed across multiple tables, necessitating data integration. Power Query was utilized to import data from Excel, followed by data cleaning and the creation of unique primary keys to establish relationships between tables. A Star Schema was implemented, centralizing the main fact table and linking dimension tables to enable efficient data retrieval and analysis.
## Data Analysis Using Power Pivot
Various calculations were performed and incorporated into Power Pivot tables to extract meaningful insights. These tables facilitated the development of KPIs and visual representations of sales trends. Key business problems addressed included:

•	Evaluating year-over-year sales performance

•	Identifying top-performing product categories

•	Analyzing order volumes and delivery efficiency

## Dashboard Development 
An Electronics Sales Dashboard was created using Power Pivot visualizations, providing stakeholders with insights into:

•	Revenue trends over time

•	Category-wise sales performance

•	Total orders and average order value

•	Delivery time improvements

## Key Findings
## 1.	Consistent Revenue Growth: 
Despite seasonal fluctuations, annual revenue showed steady growth, with Q2 consistently marking the start of significant increases each year.
## 2.	Top-Performing Products: 
Computers outperformed all other categories, nearly doubling sales compared to Home Appliances.
## 3.	Order Volume Increase:
Total orders grew each year, contributing to higher revenue.
## 4.	Improved Delivery Time:
The average delivery time improved from 7.3 days in the first year to an all-time low of 3.8 days in 2021.
## 5.	2020 Downturn:
A significant revenue decline occurred in 2020, continuing into 2021 despite improvements in other areas.
This analysis provided valuable insights for strategic decision-making, helping stakeholders understand market trends and optimize future operations.

## Insights & Recommendations:
## 1.	Capitalize on Q2 Momentum
o	Use Q2’s consistent growth as a launchpad for promotions, inventory boosts, or marketing campaigns to sustain momentum into weaker quarters.
## 2.	Double Down on Top Performers
o	Prioritize Computers (highest sales) with targeted marketing, inventory allocation, or R&D to maintain dominance. Investigate why Home Appliances underperform (e.g., pricing, demand, competition).
## 3.	Leverage Delivery Efficiency
o	Highlight faster delivery (3.8 days) in marketing to attract customers valuing speed. Monitor if this improvement correlates with higher customer retention or satisfaction.
## 4.	Address the 2020–2021 Revenue Drop
o	Investigate external factors (e.g., pandemic, supply chain) or internal issues (pricing, product mix) causing the decline despite higher orders and efficiency. Mitigate risks with contingency plans.
## Strategic Takeaway:
Strong operational performance (delivery, orders) contrasts with 2020–2021 revenue challenges. Focus on aligning product strategy (Computers), seasonal timing (Q2), and root-cause fixes for revenue dips to drive sustainable growth.
## Conclusion
This analysis provided valuable insights for strategic decision-making, helping stakeholders understand market trends and optimize future operations.
